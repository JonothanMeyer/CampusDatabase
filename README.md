# CampusDatabase
A basic database API made using Ruby on Rails. Includes basic validations for new data and authentication. By default the variable names correspond with a school database with one to one, one to many, and many to many links between objects such as 'teachers' 'Offices' 'courses' and 'sections'. Can work as a SPA with jspa as well. Has validations for each new object created with specifications relevant to each model. Uses devise for authentication purposes as well.
